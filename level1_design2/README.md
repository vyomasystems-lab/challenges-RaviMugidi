# Level1_Design2 Verification
The verification environment is setup using Vyoma's UpTickPro provided for the hackathon.

# Verification Environment
The [CoCoTb](https://www.cocotb.org/) based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives inputs to the Design Under Test (adder module here) which takes inputs  inp_bit,reset,clk  and gives 1-bit output seq_seen

The values are assigned to the input port using predefined list inputs consists only binary values.

The assert statement is used for comparing the seq_detect_1011's outut to the expected value.
```
dut.inp[i].value=inp[i]
inp_list=[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]
```

The following error is seen:
```
assert dut.seq_seen.value==output,f"Random est failed:dut.seq_seen.value=0,output=1"
AssertionError: seq_detect_1011 design failed to detect 1011 sequence.
```

# Test Scenario **(Important)**
Test inputs: inp_list=[1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] and reset=0\
Expected output: if (seq_1011_detected)
seq_seen = 1 

else 
seq_seen = 0
                 
Observed output in the DUT: DUT.seq_seen=0 even if seq_1011_detected\
\
Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a design bug.

# Design Bug
```
case(inp_bit or current_state)
  //remaing code//
    SEQ_1011:  
        begin
          next_state = SEQ_10;              #bug 
        end

```
For the sequece detector design, the seq_seen should be 1'b1 when the seq_1011 detected instead of 1'b0 as in the design code.

# Design Fix

Updating the design and re-running the test makes the test pass.
